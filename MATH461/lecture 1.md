##### How to read a math paper

read intro & abstract and look for key words:
- model: math model
- map: function
^^these suck

just look for words that make no sense
- linear operators
	- an operation that runs linearly.
	- like a matrix acting on a vector, but for a function
- spectrum of linear operators 
	- the *eigenvalue* of a function
	- number that characterize functions (important numbers)
- turbulent thermal convection
	- heat being transferred in a fluid noisy fluid
	- the transfer of heat
- global minimum
	- in this context: the minimal cooking time 
- symmetric thermal properties
- flipping burger
- cooking time
- optimization
	- try to find the most effective result
- flip-heat operator
	- combo of flip and interval time
- grilling
	- a specific kind of grilling
- sturm-louiville theory
	- framework for analyzing second-order ODEs with boundary conditions
- heat equation
	- models how heat moves through object/surface over time
	- PDE
