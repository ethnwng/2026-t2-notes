Calculus on Vector Functions 
1. Vector valued functions of one variable
2. Vector valued functions of two variables

pt 1. single variable vector functions
*motivation:* a way of thinking/visualising of single valued vector functions $\mathbf{r}(t)$ of one variable is via *parameterized curves*. We take $t$ to be the time and $\mathbf{r}(t)$ as the *position vector* which goes from the origin to the position of an object at time $t$. 

The function $\mathbf{r}(t)$ gives the parameterization of ac urve $C$. it describes the motion of a particle travelling along $C$. The calculus of $\mathbf{r}(t)$ describes the motion of the particle (velocity and acceleration) and the geometry of the curve (the curvature of the curve measures the *rate the curve is turning*)

pt2. multivariable vector functions
Study how to find derivatives and integrate *vector fields*. Geometry stuff and something else
