##### Summary of stuff
$$
\mathbf{F} \text{ conservative} \iff \int_{C} \mathbf{F} d\mathbf{r} \text{ is independent of path} \iff \int_{C} \mathbf{F}d\mathbf{r} = 0 \text{ for any closed curve}
$$
for $F$ conservative 
$2-d$: by equality of mixed partials
$$
\frac{ \partial P }{ \partial y } = \frac{ \partial Q }{ \partial x } 
$$
$3-d:$ 
$$
curl\ \mathbf{F} = \mathbf{0}
$$

*equality of mixed partials*
if $f(x,y)$ is twice differentiable on both $x$ and $y$ then
$$
\frac{ \partial^{2} f }{ \partial x \partial y }  = \frac{ \partial^{2} f }{ \partial y \partial x } 
$$


The converses of each statement is true if the domain is *simply connected*

*simply connected domains*
A domain $D$ is simply connected if every simple closed curve in $D$ encloses only points that are in $D$.
- i.e. the curve does not self intersect. and *no holes* 
- ex: $\mathbb{R}^{2}, \mathbb{R}^3$ are simply connected.
