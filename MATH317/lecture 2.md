##### Vector Valued Functions Cont.
a vector valued function $\mathbf{r}: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^3$ 
$$
\mathbf{r}(t) = <f(t),g(t),h(t)> =  f(t)\mathbf{i} + g(t)\mathbf{j} + h(t)\mathbf{k}
$$

###### Lines
Let $L$ be the line passing through some point ($x_{0},y_{0},z_{0}$) that is parallel to the vector $\mathbf{v}=<a,b,c>$.

We parameterize $L$ by using two vectors and their some. 
$$
\mathbf{r}(t) = <x_{0},y_{0},z_{0}> + t<a,b,c> = <x_{0}+ta, y_{0}+tb, z_{0}+tc>
$$
