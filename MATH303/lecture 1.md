**Motivation:** What is a *stochastic process*
- stochastic - random non-deterministic
- process - something that evolves over time (discrete/continuous)
	- discrete: $n \in \mathbb{N}$
	- continuous: $t \in \mathbb{R}, t\geq 0$

*example:* Consider a drunk person walking along a 2-dimensional grid. The person can only move left, right, up, or down. We randomly choose a direction for the person to walk using some four sided dice, with probability of moving in one direction of $\large p=\frac{1}{4}$. Each previous move is independent of the previous move and of the future move. *This process is called Markov because it does not depend on events in the past or in the future*. 

What happens if we leave the person to walk for a long time?

*Polya's Theorem:* Almost surely, the person will return to $(0,0)$ infinitely often
