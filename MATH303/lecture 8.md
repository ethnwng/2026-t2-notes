*Theorem:* The SRW on $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ is recurrent. 
*pf:* handrwnt

*Theorem:* For $d\geq 3$, the SRW on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is transient. 
*non examinable pf:* handwrnt

For these proofs we only have to show that one point is transient or recurrent because the entire system is a *communicative class*. 

*recall:* if a state $A$ is *recurrent* and is in a communicative class then every other state that it communicates is also *recurrent*. If its transient then vice versa
